This repository contains the code for transferring data from Auchencorth (and other CEH sites) via JASMIN to the Posit Connect server and other endpoints (ICOS).
It is then available for quality control with the metqc app.

The workflow is controlled by the `targets` package.

The code runs as a cron job on JASMIN `/gws/ssde/j25a/eddystore/cehmet`
